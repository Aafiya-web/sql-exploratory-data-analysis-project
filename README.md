# sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project
SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project showcasing how to clean, aggregate, and analyze raw data using SQL. Includes queries for trend analysis, key metrics, and performance insights. Demonstrates data exploration techniques for uncovering patterns and preparing data for visualization.


üß† SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This project demonstrates advanced SQL-based exploratory data analysis for business intelligence, focusing on Product and Customer performance insights.
The analysis involves creating dynamic SQL views, aggregating transactional data, and calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) to help identify business trends and customer behaviors.

üöÄ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use SQL to perform data exploration, summarization, and segmentation within a sales analytics environment.
It covers two major analytical modules:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Product Performance Report
This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.
It provides a complete view of how products perform in terms of revenue, orders, and lifecycle.
Highlights:
Retrieves product details such as product_name, category, subcategory, and cost.
Aggregates metrics:
-Total Orders
-Total Sales
-Total Quantity Sold
-Total Customers (Unique)
-Product Lifespan (in months)
-Calculates KPIs:
-Recency (months since last sale)
-Average Order Revenue (AOR)
-Average Monthly Revenue
-Segments products into performance tiers: High-Performer, Mid-Range, Low-Performer

Use Cases:
Identify which products drive revenue, which underperform, and how product lifespans influence overall sales trends.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Report
This report focuses on customer behavior and segmentation, analyzing their activity, value, and recency.
Highlights:
-Captures customer attributes such as name, age, and transaction history.
-Segments customers into meaningful groups:
-VIP Customers (high-value and long-term)
-Regular Customers (steady engagement)
-New Customers (recently acquired)
-Aggregates metrics:
-Total Orders
-Total Sales
-Total Quantity Purchased
-Total Products Bought
-Lifespan (in months)
-Calculates KPIs:
-Recency (months since last order)
-Average Order Value (AOV)
-Average Monthly Spend (AMS)
-Includes age segmentation: Under 20, 20‚Äì29, 30‚Äì39, 40‚Äì49, 50+

Use Cases:
Helps identify loyal vs inactive customers, analyze spending patterns by age, and tailor marketing or retention strategies.
